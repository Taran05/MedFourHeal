I created an online pharmacy website through which customers can buy medicines online and get them delivered to their homes.
They can also order basic necessities like N95 Masks, Sanitizers, goggles, Gloves, PPE kits in this COVID-19 situation.
This site also keeps a good check of the stock, expired medicines, prescriptions for higher-dose medicines, etc.
The site also allows the distributors to sell medicines online. It has 24*7 availability.
It also contains a chatbot for a better customer experience. Other features include cash on delivery,
payment gateway, distributor/customer verification, distributor approval, etc.
